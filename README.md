# shecodehackathon2021
#This project is a product for the competition Shecodes Hackathon 2021. 
#The product is an e-commerce website that helps connect farmers and buyers during the epidemic season.

Because we are only at the newbie level, we only build a basic website including: homepage, search results page, information page of each product, product display page by category, login page for users, product posting pages...

#I am in charge of the frontend part for this project. html and css are the two main skills that I used.
